# Netflix Data Analysis and Machine Learning
This project analyzes Netflix user data to predict user behavior and churn using machine learning models. The dataset includes information such as subscription type, age, country, and device used.

# Project Overview
# Data Cleaning: 
Handle missing values, convert date columns, and preprocess the data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize key features and analyze correlations.
# Feature Engineering: 
Encode categorical variables and scale numerical features.
# Machine Learning Models: 
Build predictive models to forecast user churn and behavior.
# Tools and Libraries
Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Numpy
# Results
The project includes machine learning model evaluations and performance metrics, showing how well the models predict user churn.
